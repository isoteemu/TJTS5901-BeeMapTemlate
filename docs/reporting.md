# Weekly assignment - documentation / reporting requirements

All the code in JYU Gitlab needs to be well documented
i.e. by reading your code, the reader understands what you have done based on the documentation without need for further explanation.

In addition, create a weekly `.md` text file in `docs` -folder, in which you will report on:
 - The tasks that you have performed (e.g. setting up the technology stack)
 - How have you addressed the top 10 web application security risks (OWASP)?
